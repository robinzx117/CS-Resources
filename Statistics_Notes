Data: 1.Numbers 2.Images 3.Words 4.Audio

Two key types of data:
    Organic/Process Data
    "Designed" Data Collection

For analyzing data, regardless of source, an important question:
Q: Can the Data be considered i.i.d.? i = independent and id = identically distributed

Variable Types:
1.Quantitative Variables: Numerical, measurable quantities in which arithmetic operations often make sense.
  Continuous – could take on any value within an interval, many possible values.
  Discrete – countable value, finite number of values.
2.Categorical (or Qualitative) Variables: Classifies individuals or items into different groups.
  Ordinal – groups have an order or ranking.
  Nominal – groups are merely names, no ranking.
