Volatile memory: in contrast to non-volatile memory, is computer memory that requires power to maintain the stored information; it retains its contents while powered on but when
                 the power is interrupted, the stored data is quickly lost. Volatile memory has several uses including as primary storage. In addition to usually being faster
                 than forms of mass storage such as a hard disk drive, volatility can protect sensitive information, as it becomes unavailable on power-down. Most of the
                 general-purpose random-access memory(RAM) is volatile.

Non-volatile memory: a type of computer memory that can retrieve stored information even after having been power cycled. Examples of non-volatile memory include flash memory,
                     read-only memory(ROM), ferroelectric RAM, most types of magnetic computer storage devices (e.g. hard disk drives, floppy disks, and magnetic tape), optical
                     discs, and early computer storage methods such as paper tape and punched cards.
