Internet Protocol(IP):
    -is the principal communications protocol in the Internet protocol suite for relaying datagrams across network boundaries. Its routing function enables internet working, and
     essentially establishes the Internet. IP has the task of delivering packets from the source host to the destination host solely based on the IP addresses in the packet
     headers. For this purpose, IP defines packet structures that encapsulate the data to be delivered. It also defines addressing methods that are used to label the datagram
     with source and destination information.

Internet Protocol address(IP address):
    -is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. An IP address serves two main functions: host
     or network interface identification and location addressing.

Internet Protocol version 4(IPv4):
    -IPv4 uses a 32-bit address space which provides 4,294,967,296 (2^32) unique addresses, but large blocks are reserved for special networking methods.
     Address range: 0.0.0.0â€“255.255.255.255

Internet Protocol version 6(IPv6):
    -In IPv6, the address size was increased from 32 bits in IPv4 to 128 bits, thus providing up to 2^128 addresses.

Ping:
    -is a computer network administration software utility used to test the reachability of a host on an Internet Protocol(IP) network. It is available for virtually all
     operating systems that have networking capability, including most embedded network administration software.
     Ping measures the round-trip time for messages sent from the originating host to a destination computer that are echoed back to the source. The name comes from active sonar
     terminology that sends a pulse of sound and listens for the echo to detect objects under water.
     Ping operates by sending Internet Control Message Protocol(ICMP) echo request packets to the target host and waiting for an ICMP echo reply. The program reports errors,
     packet loss, and a statistical summary of the results, typically including the minimum, maximum, the mean round-trip times, and standard deviation of the mean.

ipconfig:
    -is a console application program of some computer operating systems that displays all current TCP/IP network configuration values and refreshes Dynamic Host Configuration
     Protocol(DHCP) and Domain Name System(DNS) settings.
