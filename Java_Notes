Access modifier:
If we do not specify any access modifier, it becomes “package-private”.
Package-private means the variable or method or class is accessible to its own class, and also to any other class in the same package.

In the Java programming language, every application must contain a main method whose signature is:
public static void main(String[] args)
The main method accepts a single argument: an array of elements of type String.
This array is the mechanism through which the runtime system passes information to your application. For example:
java MyApp arg1 arg2
Each string in the array is called a command-line argument. Command-line arguments let users affect the operation of the application
without recompiling it.

Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
